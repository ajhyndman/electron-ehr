  "zisis": "Specifically, I reviewed in detail with this patient, the Internation Spinal Intervention Society (ISIS) diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm for facet joint spondylosis. We reviewed the value of cervicallumbarmedial branch nerve block proven facet spondylosis for longer term palliation with RF neurolysis of the same. We reviewed procedural technique, potential risks, and reasonable expectations.",
  "zsurgconsult": "We discussed alternatives including potential surgical evaluation and surgical options such as decompression laminectomy and/or possible fusion.",
  "zscs": "We discussed spinal cord stimulators for long term palliation of back pain and reviewed restrictions with this technology including incompatibility with MRIs and pace-makers. I reviewed with the patient information specifically dealing with the new technology, 10,000 hertz high frequency spinal cord stimulation, for coverage of back and leg pain, FDA supported efficacy, requirements, and opportunity to undergo the procedure at our facility. I reviewed with the patient the difference between this technology compared to the old system with data from European and American studies that support these assertions. We reviewed specifics regarding current availability with Nevro Systems in hospital market.I reviewed requirements for consideration of spinal cord stimulator trial including psychiatric evaluation and explained rationale for the same.",
  "zsidisc": "I reviewed the patient's concerns and complaints and noted substantial component of disc discomfort is midline axial spine in distribution. I expressed my belief that these complaints are typically related to discogenic pain generators. I also reviewed my experience that offering injections including TFESI and facet joint treatments do not substantially impact these complaints in a positive fashion.",
  "zptvalue": "We also discussed the value of physical therapy options to include dry needling for endorphin release, cord spine stabilization exercises, and life-style accommodations.",
  "zptnew": "We have offered the patient referral for physical therapy and reviewed specific do's and don'ts and encouraged the same.",
  "zptcont": "We encouraged to continue physical therapy and explained rationale for the recommendation.",
  "zaquavalue": "We reviewed the value of aquatics therapy, specifically the value of buoyancy for better spine health and less pain for exercise in that environment.",
  "zaquanew": "We have offered the patient referral for aquatics therapy and reviewed specific do's and don'ts and encouraged the same."
