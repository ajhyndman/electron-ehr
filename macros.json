  "zoapt": "We will need permission from the patient's primary care physician or internal medicine doctor to withhold _ . We reviewed in detail slightly increased risks and reasonable expectations regarding undergoing injections while on oral anti-platelet therapy versus risks of withholding the medication. Recent data suggests risks of discontinuing these medicines may exceed the risks of bleeding or bruising with the injections. With that in mind, patients in particular who cannot safely withhold their anticoagulants, we offer to provide injections without stopping these medications using 25 to 26 gauge needles. We have not seen any problems or complications relative to bruising or bleeding. These observations were made on case by case basis. There is a national data supporting this approach of not withholding oral anticoagulants when providing therapeutic spinal injections.",
